//! Adapter for the replication backend.
//!
//! When the crate is compiled with the `replication-v3` feature, the
//! `link-replication` backend is enabled. Note that the types, even though
//! similarly named, are different, as are the semantics. While `replication-v3`
//! is being stabilised it should be possible to swap the backends for smoke
//! testing, provided the default parameters are used and the return types are
//! not inspected.
